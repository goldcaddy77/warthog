Warthog is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) GraphQL API framework for building consistent GraphQL APIs that have sorting, filtering and pagination out of the box. It is written in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) and makes heavy use of decorators for concise, declarative code.

## Intentionally Opinionated Framework

Warthog is an opinionated framework that makes use of the following technology-specific features to accelerate development:

- Postgres - currently the only database supported. This could be changed, but choosing Postgres allows adding a docker container and other goodies easily.
- Jest - other harnesses will work, but if you use Jest, we will not open the GraphQL playground when the server starts.
- Soft deletes - no records are ever deleted, only "soft deleted". The base service used in resolvers filters out the deleted records by default.

## Philosophy

When teams build products quickly, even if they have strong conventions and good linters, the GraphQL can quickly become inconsistent, making it difficult for clients to consume the APIs in a reusable way.

To prevent this, Warthog automatically generates the following:

- Database schema - generated by [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm).
- GraphQL Schema including:
  - Types to match your entities - generated by [TypeGraphQL](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql).
  - GraphQL inputs for consistent creates, updates, filtering, and pagination inspired by [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma)'s conventions.
- [Graphql-binding](https://github.com/graphql-binding/graphql-binding) for type-safe programmatic access to your APIs.
- TypeScript classes for the generated GraphQL schema to ensure type-safety while developing.

Further, Warthog covers the following concerns by hooking into best-in-class open source libraries:

- Validation: Automatic validation before data is saved using any of the decorators available in the [class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator#validation-decorators) library.
