## Summary

Warthog is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) GraphQL API framework for quickly building consistent GraphQL APIs that have sorting, filtering and pagination out of the box. It is written in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) and makes heavy use of decorators for concise, declarative code.

## Philosophy

This library is intentionally opinionated and generates as much code as possible. When teams build products quickly, even if they have strong conventions and good linters, the GraphQL can quickly become inconsistent, making it difficult for clients to consume the APIs in a reusable way.

To do this, Warthog automatically generates the following:

- Database schema - generated by [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm)
- Your entire GraphQL Schema including:
  - types to match your entities - generated by [TypeGraphQL](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql)
  - GraphQL inputs for consistent creates, updates, filtering, and pagination
    inspired by [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma)'s conventions
- A [graphql-binding](https://github.com/graphql-binding/graphql-binding) for
  type-safe programmatic access to your APIs.
- TypeScript classes for the generated GraphQL schema for type-safety while developing.

Further, it covers the following concerns by hooking into best-in-class open source libraries:

- Validation: Automatic validation before data is saved using any of the decorators available in the [class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator#validation-decorators) library.

## Prerequisites

Warthog currently only supports PostgreSQL as a DB engine, so you must have Postgres installed before getting Warthog set up. (Note: Postgres 12 is not currently supported)

<details>
<summary>Expand for Postgres installation options</summary>
<p>

### Homebrew (OSX)

If you're on OSX and have [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and [homebrew-cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask) installed, you can simply run:

```bash
brew cask install postgres
```

Or you can install Homebrew's official version:

```bash
brew install postgresql
`brew --prefix`/opt/postgres/bin/createuser -s postgres
```

### Postgres.app (OSX)

Otherwise, you can install [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/) manually.

### Docker

See the [warthog-starter](https://github.com/goldcaddy77/warthog-starter/pull/6/files) project for how to use Docker to run Postgres.

</p>
</details>

## Usage

### Cloning the starter project

The easiest way to start using Warthog for a fresh project is to clone the [warthog-starter](https://github.com/goldcaddy77/warthog-starter) repo. To get the starter project up and running, do the following:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:goldcaddy77/warthog-starter.git
cd warthog-starter
yarn bootstrap
WARTHOG_AUTO_OPEN_PLAYGROUND=true yarn start:dev
```

### Create new project with the CLI

```bash
yarn global add warthog@beta

yarn warthog new

# Generate a resource (model, resolver and service)
yarn warthog generate user name! nickname age:int! verified:bool!

# Generate typescript classes and GraphQL schema
yarn warthog codegen

# Create your DB
yarn warthog db:create

# Generate the DB migration for your newly generated model
yarn warthog db:migrate:generate --name=create-user-table

# Run the DB migration
yarn warthog db:migrate

# Start the server
yarn start:dev


```

### Installing in Existing Project

To install in an existing project, you'll need to create several files in place and then you'll need to call a few Warthog CLI commands that:

- Generate a new resource
- Create a database
- Create a DB migration and run it
- Run the server

The following code will get you bootstrapped. You should read through this before running:

```bash
# Install Warthog
yarn add warthog

# Ensure you have the `postgres` user in your DB
`which createuser` -s postgres

# Pull down several nessesary files from the warthog-starter example
declare -a arr=(".env" "warthog.config.js" "tsconfig.json" "src/config.ts" "src/index.ts" "src/logger.ts" "src/server.ts")
for i in "${arr[@]}"
do
  if [ ! -f ./$i ]; then
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goldcaddy77/warthog-starter/master/$i -o $i
  fi
done

# Create a .env file with your app and DB settings (modify these as needed)
printf "DEBUG=*
NODE_ENV=development
WARTHOG_AUTO_OPEN_PLAYGROUND=true
WARTHOG_APP_HOST=localhost
WARTHOG_APP_PORT=4100
WARTHOG_DB_DATABASE=warthog-starter
WARTHOG_DB_HOST=localhost
WARTHOG_DB_PASSWORD=
WARTHOG_DB_PORT=5432
WARTHOG_DB_SYNCHRONIZE=true
WARTHOG_DB_USERNAME=postgres" > .env

# Create your first model (See https://github.com/goldcaddy77/warthog#generate-command-in-depth for more info)
yarn warthog generate user name! nickname age:int! verified:bool!

# Generate typescript classes and GraphQL schema
yarn warthog codegen

# Create your DB
yarn warthog db:create

# Generate the DB migration for your newly generated model
yarn warthog db:migrate:generate --name=create-user-table

# Run the DB migration
yarn warthog db:migrate

# Start the server
yarn ts-node --type-check src/index.ts
```

This will open up GraphQL Playground, where you can execute queries and mutations against your API.

First, add a user by entering the following in the window:

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(data: { name: "Test User", age: 25, verified: false }) {
    id
    name
    createdAt
  }
}
```

Then, query for this user:

```graphql
query {
  users {
    id
    name
    createdAt
  }
}
```

See [introducing-graphql-playground](https://www.prisma.io/blog/introducing-graphql-playground-f1e0a018f05d) for more info about GraphQL Playground.

### Running the examples in the Warthog repo

You can also clone the Warthog repo and run the examples in the [examples](./examples/README.md) folder.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:goldcaddy77/warthog.git
cd warthog/examples/01-simple-model
yarn bootstrap
yarn db:seed:dev
yarn start
```

This has a simple example in place to get you started. There are also a bunch of examples in the folder for more advanced use cases.

Note that the examples in the [examples](./examples/README.md) folder use relative import paths to call into Warthog. In your projects, you won't need to set this config value as it's only set to deal with the fact that it's using the Warthog core files without consuming the package from NPM. In your projects, you can omit this as I do in [warthog-starter](https://github.com/goldcaddy77/warthog-starter).

### Warthog Constructs Explained

#### Models

A model represents both a GraphQL type and a DB table. Warthog exposes a [BaseModel](https://github.com/goldcaddy77/warthog/blob/master/src/core/BaseModel.ts) class that provides the following columns for free: `id`, `createdAt`, `createdById`, `updatedAt`, `updatedById`, `deletedAt`, `deletedById`, `version`. If you use BaseModel in conjunction with BaseService (see below), all of these columns will be updated as you'd expect. The Warthog server will find all models that match the following glob - `'/**/*.model.ts'`. Ex: `user.model.ts`

#### Resolvers

A Warthog resolver exposes queries (reading data) and mutations (writing data). They interact with the DB through `services` (described below) and typically make use of a bunch of auto-generated TypeScript types in the `generated` folder for things like sorting and filtering. Warthog will find all resolvers that match the following glob - `'/**/*.resolver.ts'`. Ex: `user.resolver.ts`

#### Services

Services are the glue between resolvers and models. Warthog exposes a class called [BaseService](https://github.com/goldcaddy77/warthog/blob/master/src/core/BaseService.ts) that exposes the following methods: `find`, `findOne`, `create`, `update`, `delete`. For the `find` operator, it also maps the auto-generated `WhereInput` attributes to the appropriate TypeORM Query Builders. Warthog's convention is to name services `<model-name>.service.ts`. Ex: `user.service.ts`

#### Generated Folder

When you start your server, there will be a new `generated` folder that Warthog creates automatically. The folder contains:

- classes.ts: Warthog auto-generates this file from the metadata it collects (from decorators like `Model`, `Query`, `Resolver`, `StringField`, etc...). Resolvers will import items from here instead of having to manually create them.
- schema.graphql: This is auto-generated from our resolvers, models and `classes.ts` above. Check out [this example's schema.graphql](https://github.com/goldcaddy77/warthog/blob/master/examples/01-simple-model/generated/schema.graphql) to show the additional GraphQL schema Warthog autogenerates.
- ormconfig.ts: a TypeORM [ormconfig](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/docs/using-ormconfig.md) file.
- binding.ts - a [graphql-binding](https://www.prisma.io/docs/1.10/graphql-ecosystem/graphql-binding/graphql-binding-quaidah9ph) for type-safe programmatic access to your API (making real API calls)

## Server API (appOptions)

Most of the config in Warthog is done via environment variables (see `Config - Environment Variables` below). However, more complex/dynamic objects should be passed via the server config.

| attribute                 | description                                                                                               | default                                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| container                 | TypeDI container. Warthog uses dependency injection under the hood.                                       | empty container                               |
| authChecker               | An instance of an [AuthChecker](https://typegraphql.ml/docs/authorization.html) to secure your resolvers. |                                               |
| context                   | Context getter of form `(request: Request) => object`                                                     | empty                                         |
| logger                    | Logger                                                                                                    | [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) |
| middlewares               | [TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.ml/docs/middlewares.html) middlewares to add to your server             | none                                          |
| onBeforeGraphQLMiddleware | Callback executed just before the Graphql server is started. The Express app is passed.                   | none                                          |
| onAfterGraphQLMiddleware  | Callback executed just after the Graphql server is started. The Express app is passed.                    | none                                          |

## Config - Environment Variables

Almost all config in Warthog is driven by environment variables. The following items are available:

| variable                     | value                                       | default                     |

## Field/Column Decorators

All of the auto-generation magic comes from the decorators added to the attributes on your models. Warthog decorators are convenient wrappers around TypeORM decorators (to create DB schema) and TypeGraphQL (to create GraphQL schema). You can find a list of decorators available in the [src/decorators](./src/decorators) folder. Most of these are also used in the [examples](./examples) folder in this project.

## Complex use cases/ejecting

Warthog makes building simple CRUD endpoints incredibly easy. However, since it is built on top of TypeORM and TypeGraphQL it is flexible enough to handle complex use cases as well.

### DB-only

If you need to add a column to the DB that does not need to be exposed via the API, you should just use [the TypeORM decorators](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/docs/decorator-reference.md)

### API-only

If you need to add a field that is only exposed via the API that is not DB-backed, you should just use [the TypeGraphQL Field Decorator](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql/blob/master/src/decorators/Field.ts)

### Custom Query

See the [feature-flag example](./examples/07-feature-flags/) for an example of where we'd want to build something beyond the standard CRUD actions. In this example we want to add a custom query that makes a complex DB call.

- First add the query to the resolver - [link to code](https://github.com/goldcaddy77/warthog/blob/master/examples/07-feature-flags/src/feature-flag/feature-flag.resolver.ts#L75-L79)
- Then add the custom query input in the resolver - [link to code](https://github.com/goldcaddy77/warthog/blob/master/examples/07-feature-flags/src/feature-flag/feature-flag.resolver.ts#L31-L41)
- Then add the custom service method that fetches the data [link to code](https://github.com/goldcaddy77/warthog/blob/master/examples/07-feature-flags/src/feature-flag/feature-flag.service.ts#L28-L48)

Warthog will generate the correct GraphQL query and InputType automatically.

## CLI

Warthog ships with the following commands that can be accessed by running `yarn warthog <command>`.

See the [warthog-starter](https://github.com/goldcaddy77/warthog-starter/blob/master/package.json) project's package.json for example usage.

| Command           | Args      | Description                                                                             |
| ----------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| codegen           | none      | autogenerates code from decorated models and resolvers and places in `generated` folder |
| db:create         | none      | creates DB based on DB specified in config file                                         |
| db:drop           | none      | drops DB based on DB specified in config file                                           |
| generate          | See below | generates a model, service and resolver                                                 |
| db:migrate        | none      | migrates DB (proxies through TypeORM CLI)                                               |
| db:migrate:create | none      | auto-generates DB migration based on new code additions (proxies through TypeORM CLI)   |

### `generate` Command in depth

The `generate` command will create a new resolver, service and model for a given resource. Let's start with a complex example and we'll break it down:

```bash
yarn warthog generate user name! nickname numLogins:int! verified:bool! registeredAt:date balance:float! --folder my_generated_folder
```

- `user` - this is the name of the new resource (required)
- ...args - each of the remaining args until `--folder` is a field on the resource
- `name!` - the name field is of type string by default since no data type is specified. The `!` states that it's required
- `numLogins:int!` - numLogins states that it is of type int - also required
- `registeredAt:date` - registeredAt is of type date (which correlates to an ISO8601 datetime). The absence of the `!` means it is optional.
- ...the rest of the args are self-explanatory. Possible types are `bool`, `date`, `int`, `float` and `string`. If you need to use other types, just add them as strings and update the models manually.
- `--folder` - this allows you to explicitly set the folder where the generated files should go. This is not recommended and instead you should use the .rc file (see below)

## `warthogrc` config file

Warthog uses [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig) for config that shouldn't change between environments (so typically file paths). This means you can put any of the following config files in your project root:

- .warthogrc.json
- .warthogrc.yaml
- .warthogrc.js
- warthog.config.js file (exporting a JS object)

The following config options are currently available:

| Config Key      | Description                                                                  | Equivalent Environment Variable |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| generatedFolder | Relative location to generated folder (relative path from the config file)   | WARTHOG_GENERATED_FOLDER        |
| cliGeneratePath | Where should CLI place generated files? (relative path from the config file) | WARTHOG_CLI_GENERATE_PATH       |
| resolversPath   | Where should Warthog look for resolvers? (comma-delimited list of regexes)   | WARTHOG_RESOLVERS_PATH          |

Note that for `cliGeneratePath`, you can interpolate in the following strings to generate dynamic paths:

- `className` (pascal case)
- `camelName` (camel case)
- `kebabName` (kebab case)

Example:

```json
{
  "cliGeneratePath": "./src/${kebabName}"
}
```

Running `yarn warthog generate featureFlag` would create 3 files in the `./src/feature-flag/` folder. See [feature-flag example](./examples/7-feature-flags/warthog.config.js) for a live example.

## Usage in Production

It is recommended that you not run Warthog's TypeScript files via `ts-node` in Production as we do in development as `ts-node` has been known to cause issues in some smaller AWS instances. Instead, compile down to JS and run in `node`. For a full project example (using [dotenvi](https://github.com/b3ross/dotenvi) for config management), see [warthog-starter](https://github.com/goldcaddy77/warthog-starter)

## Contributing

PRs accepted, fire away! Or add issues if you have use cases Warthog doesn't cover.

Before contributing, make sure you have Postgres installed and running with a user named `postgres` with an empty password. If you don't have this local Postgres user, you'll need to update the `.env` files in the `examples` folders to point to a user that can run DB migrations.

Once you have this user set up, you can build a specific example by navigating to that folder and running `yarn bootstrap`.

If you want to build all examples, you can run `yarn bootstrap` from the Warthog root folder.

It's helpful to add a new feature to the Warthog and make use of it in one of the examples folders until you've determined how it's going to work. Once you have it working, you can add tests.

## Intentionally Opinionated

Warthog is intentionally opinionated to accelerate development and make use of technology-specific features:

- Postgres - currently the only database supported. This could be changed, but choosing Postgres allows adding a docker container and other goodies easily.
- Jest - other harnesses will work, but if you use Jest, we will not open the GraphQL playground when the server starts, for example.
- Soft deletes - no records are ever deleted, only "soft deleted". The base service used in resolvers filters out the deleted records by default.

## Thanks

Special thanks to:

- [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm) - DB generation
- [TypeGraphQL](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql) - GraphQL generation
- [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) - [OpenCrud](https://github.com/opencrud/opencrud) conventions
- [richardbmx](https://github.com/richardbmx) - Logo design

Warthog is essentially a really opinionated composition of TypeORM and TypeGraphQL that uses similar GraphQL conventions to the Prisma project.
